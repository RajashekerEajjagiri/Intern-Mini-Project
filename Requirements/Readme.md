# Introduction

 - In science and technology, the desire for improvement is a constant subject which triggers
   advancements. This is visible in every ramification and the airline industry is not an exemption.
- Airline reservation systems were first introduced in the late 1950s as relatively simple standalone
  systems to control flight inventory, maintain flight schedules, seat assignments and aircraft
  loading. 
-  Today modern airlines ticket booking systems are comprehensive suites of products to
provide systems that assist with a variety of airline management tasks and service customer
needs from the time of initial reservation through completion of the flight.
- The World Wide Web has become tremendously popular over the last ten years, and currently
most of the airlines have made provision for online reservation of their flights. 
- The Internet has become a major resource for people looking for making reservations online without 
 the hassle of meeting travel agents by implementing an online reservation system. 

- A Computer Reservations System is a computerized system used to store and retrieve
information and conduct transactions related to travel.
- Secure and stable systems are vital to theairline industry which is why companies spend many years 
designing an architecture specificallysuited to the nature of the airline industry which often requires 
tens of thousands of users to access and use the system simultaneously.

# Research
- Rwenzori Airlines started as a small airline carrier in 1989 to facilitate air travel between Uganda
and the Democratic Republic of Congo. This airline was to facilitate transportation of cargo between the two countries.
- The airline was originally designed to handle small number of customers. In 1999 Rwenzori Airline was transformed into
   an International Airline facilitating travel of tens of thousands of passengers on a daily basis.
 
- Today Rwenzori Airlines still use a manual system of flight booking, flight management and scheduling. Flight booking is done
through travel agents across major towns, flight data and customer details are kept in manual files. 
- This system is slow and results into booking conflicts, vacant seats in some planes and it is
hard to quickly obtain customer information in case of emergency. 
- based on the above reason, We set out to design an online airline reservation system to provides a modern, flexible
reservation and inventory management solutions including call Centre, travel agency, internet
engine, global distribution systems and interlines booking with case study of Rwenzori Airlines.
